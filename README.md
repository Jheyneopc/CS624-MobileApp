# Input  
For this project, the app doesn’t take input from the user like typing or clicking buttons. Instead, I use some text and an image already added in the code. This includes a name, job title, and a short description. These are displayed on the screen using built in React Native components.

# Process  
The app is built using React Native. I created a profile card using components like "View", "Text", and "Image". I also used StyleSheet to style the text, background, layout, and spacing to make it look nice. All the code is organized in different folders like app, assets, and components to keep everything clean and easy to understand.

# Output  
The final result is a mobile app screen that shows a simple profile card. It displays the person’s name, job, and a short description, along with an image. The layout looks clean and friendly. We added screenshots to show that the app works as expected.

# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

PE03/

INPUT
The app allows users to type tasks into a text input field. The input is stored temporarily and is used to create a new item in the to-do list when the user presses the Submit button.

PROCESS
When the app starts, it uses React Native to display the main screen. The user types in a task and clicks Submit. This triggers a function that adds the task to an array in the app’s state. The user can then mark tasks as “Done” or “Delete” them. There is also a tab bar at the bottom that filters the list to show All, Active (not done), or Completed (done) tasks. The app updates its view based on the selected tab and any changes made.

OUTPUT
The output is a to-do list that updates live on the screen. Tasks can be filtered, completed, or removed. The design is simple and mobile-friendly.


PE02/

INPUT:
The app lets users type their favorite course (like "CS624") into a text box. It also loads a picture from the assets folder (cityu-image.jpg) and uses hardcoded course lists (core, depth, and capstone) to display on the screen.

PROCESS:
When the app starts, it uses React Native components like View, Text, Image, TextInput, ScrollView, and StyleSheet. It shows a scrollable screen where the image appears at the top, and below it, the input field and course lists are styled and displayed clearly.

OUTPUT:
The user sees a nice mobile screen with a CityU image, an input box to type in a course, and a list of MSCS courses grouped under Core Requirements, Depth of Study, and Capstone. The layout is organized with color highlights and works on both web and mobile using Expo.


# CS-624-
PE01/
INPUT:
There is no direct user input in this app. The content is hard-coded into the app in a way that would display a message with my name, degree program, and university name. The data is written using React Native Text components.

PROCESS:
The app was built using GitHub Codespaces with Expo and React Native. So I used a View to store everything and three Text components to display each line of my message. The layout of the app is styled using StyleSheet as per the assignment requirement. I applied a yellow background color to the View to meet the user requirements and also centered the text in the middle of the screen using basic style properties.

OUTPUT 
When the app runs, it displays a yellow screen with my name, program name, and school name (CityU) displayed across three lines. This serves the purpose of creating a simple mobile app.
